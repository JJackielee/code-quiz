# code-quiz

## Description

This is a code quiz that ask the user questions about Javascript. It is a multiple choice quiz so there will be question prompted and four buttons for each answer. This is also a timed quiz so your score is base off of how much time  you have left when you complete the quiz. You are then able to submit your score the a tracked highscore list on your computer. After submiting the highscore you can then view the list of scores. 

What I learned from this project is the usage of Eventlistener and DOM manipulation in javascript. I was able to listen to user actions via forms and buttons and make it call a function whenever the item has been clicked. I also learned how to create HTML in javascript and select elements in the HTML to manipulate in Javascript.
